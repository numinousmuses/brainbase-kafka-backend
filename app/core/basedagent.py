    Process a new message using the Based agent logic.
    
    Inputs:
      - model: The model name (e.g., "Claude 3.7")
      - prompt: The text prompt from the user.
      - is_first_prompt: True if this is the first message in the conversation.
      - is_chat_or_composer: True if the response should be written to a .based file 
                             (i.e. handled as a based file) or False if itâ€™s simply a plain message.
    
    Returns a dictionary with:
      - "output": The generated text (either full based file content, a diff, or a plain message).
      - "type": One of "based", "diff", or "response".
      - Optionally "based_filename": A filename (e.g., "sample.based") if applicable.
      - Optionally "message": A plain message if type is "response".
      
    For simulation, this function returns dummy values.
